<h1>Parking Map</h1>
<h2>PLEASE do NOT park in front of people's driveways!! It causes lots of problems for neighbors, the beach, and everyone.</h2>
<h4>We also strongly encourage the use of public transit, carpooling, bicycles, and other means of transport to get to the beach -- both because parking is limited, and beacuse it's good for our community and the environment!</h4>
<h4>Note: This map is NOT legal advice, and may have mistakes: please consult all area signs and laws before parking your car.<br/>
    Please let us know at <a href="mailto:friendsofdennyblaine@gmail.com">friendsofdennyblaine@gmail.com</a> if you find any issues or mistakes in this map so we can correct them!</h4>
<p>There is also a city map <a href="https://seattlecitygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5814e3f6c7054a40a9b4d175dcbf294b">here.</a> The map in your hands was created to encourage legal parking, and because the city map marks many areas as legal parking that are not safe or seemingly legal to park in.</p>

<p><b>Key:</b> <br/>
    <b>Green</b> - legal parking. <br/>
    <b>Red</b> - No parking.<br/>
    <b>Blue</b> - Don't park here. Unclear if this area is legal parking! (Usually, this means the city map has it marked as legal, and there's no signs, but it seems like there isn't or shouldn't be parking there.)</p>

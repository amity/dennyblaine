        <h2>Formal Recognition of Clothing-Optional and LGBTQ+ Usage</h2>
        <p>We're working with the Parks department on getting clothing-optional and LGBTQ+ community uses of the beach officially recognized. Once done, we're excited to add signs to the beach indicating this, so beachgoers don't feel like they're in legal jeopardy for being nude, or at risk as a queer or trans beachgoer!</p>

        <h2>Signage</h2>
        <p>This will be done through the Parks department; it doesn't seem like funding is needed at this time. We're working on adding signs both recognizing the clothing-optional designation and encouraging folks to be respectful, as well as potentially signage recognizing the queer history of the beach!</p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous Projects</h2>
        <p>Down the line, we've got a lot of projects that we're working with the Parks Department on taking on, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Replacement of invasive thorny blackberry bushes from lower level with native and nude-friendly plants</li>
            <li>Accessibility improvements (including handrails) to the dangerous stairs going down to beach-level</li>
            <li>Restoration of parking on the north side of the loop</li>
            <li>Improvements to the scratchy, patchy grass on the middle level</li>
            <li>Improved trash pickup and bathroom facilities</li>
        </ul>

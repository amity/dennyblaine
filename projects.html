        <h2>Formal Clothing-Optional Designation</h2>
        <p>We're working with the Parks department and the City Council on getting the beach officially designated clothing-optional. Once done, we're excited to add signs to the beach indicating this. </p>

        <h2>Signage</h2>
        <p>This will be done through the Parks department; it doesn't seem like funding is needed at this time. We're working on adding signs both recognizing the clothing-optional designation and encouraging folks to be respectful, as well as potentially signage recognizing the queer history of the beach!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Restoration of parking on the north side of the loop</li>
            <li>Improvements to the scratchy, patchy grass on the middle level</li>
            <li>Replacement of invasive thorny blackberry bushes from lower level</li>
